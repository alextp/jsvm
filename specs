Hi everyone,

Here's assignment 1.
You will do this in teams of 2 or 3 (please send me a note ASAP indicating your team preferences).
It is due 11:59pm on 10/16.

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with a particular instruction set,
namely the Java virtual machine, and a dynamic language, namely JavaScript.

You will implement a simple interpreter for the Java bytecodes.

A follow-on assignment will involve a compiler-like transformation to this code,
so please plan your project accordingly.

I would first parse everything into an appropriate internal representation and then
run your interpreter on that. It would also make a lot of sense to break out the
various operations into classes, organized by functionality.

Note that JavaScript has no built-in support for threads; for this assignment, you may
treat synchronization operations as NOPs.

You may, as a class, discuss all details of this assignment -- and I encourage you to do so
via this mail alias. However, no code can be shared across teams. All assignments will
be submitted via a script which will automatically do plagiarism detection, so plan accordingly.
